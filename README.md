# MSLedit

A string builder and editor library written in C++11.

## How to build

Just do not try to do it on clang for now, it has problems (unless you remove the wall and pedantic flags).

```
make
./bin-src/bin/msledit.exe
```
 
## Commands
  
For good up to date list, use the help command in the MSLedit binary (any version will do)
   
> This part is edited with the windows version of the native MSLedit binary

- h, help: Ask for help
- q, quit, exit: Exit this thing
- v, view, p, print: Print the current document
